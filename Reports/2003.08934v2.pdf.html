We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an under- lying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non- convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coor- dinate (spatial location (x, y, z) and viewing direction (θ, φ)) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally diﬀerentiable, the only input required to optimize our repre- sentation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to eﬀectively optimize neural radiance ﬁelds to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demon- strate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#14</span>Keywords: scene representation, view synthesis, image-based render- ing, volume rendering, 3D deep learning</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#15</span>1 Introduction</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#16</span>In this work, we address the long-standing problem of view synthesis in a new way by directly optimizing parameters of a continuous 5D scene representation to minimize the error of rendering a set of captured images.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#17</span>We represent a static scene as a continuous 5D function that outputs the radiance emitted in each direction (θ, φ) at each point (x, y, z) in space, and a density at each point which acts like a diﬀerential opacity controlling how much radiance is accumulated by a ray passing through (x, y, z). Our method optimizes a deep fully-connected neural network without any convolutional layers (often referred to as a multilayer perceptron or MLP) to represent this function by regressing from a single 5D coordinate (x, y, z, θ, φ) to a single volume density and view-dependent RGB color. To render this neural radiance ﬁeld (NeRF)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#18</span>(cid:63) Authors contributed equally to this work.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#19</span>2</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#20</span>B.

Tancik et al.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#21</span>Fig. 1: We present a method that optimizes a continuous 5D neural radiance ﬁeld representation (volume density and view-dependent color at any continuous location) of a scene from a set of input images. We use techniques from volume rendering to accumulate samples of this scene representation along rays to render the scene from any viewpoint. Here, we visualize the set of 100 input views of the synthetic Drums scene randomly captured on a surrounding hemisphere, and we show two novel views rendered from our optimized NeRF representation.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#22</span>from a particular viewpoint we: 1) march camera rays through the scene to generate a sampled set of 3D points, 2) use those points and their corresponding 2D viewing directions as input to the neural network to produce an output set of colors and densities, and 3) use classical volume rendering techniques to accumulate those colors and densities into a 2D image. Because this process is naturally diﬀerentiable, we can use gradient descent to optimize this model by minimizing the error between each observed image and the corresponding views rendered from our representation. Minimizing this error across multiple views encourages the network to predict a coherent model of the scene by assigning high volume densities and accurate colors to the locations that contain the true underlying scene content. Figure 2 visualizes this overall pipeline.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#23</span>We ﬁnd that the basic implementation of optimizing a neural radiance ﬁeld representation for a complex scene does not converge to a suﬃciently high- resolution representation and is ineﬃcient in the required number of samples per camera ray. We address these issues by transforming input 5D coordinates with a positional encoding that enables the MLP to represent higher frequency func- tions, and we propose a hierarchical sampling procedure to reduce the number of queries required to adequately sample this high-frequency scene representation. Our approach inherits the beneﬁts of volumetric representations: both can represent complex real-world geometry and appearance and are well suited for gradient-based optimization using projected images. Crucially, our method over- comes the prohibitive storage costs of discretized voxel grids when modeling complex scenes at high-resolutions. In summary, our technical contributions are: – An approach for representing continuous scenes with complex geometry and materials as 5D neural radiance ﬁelds, parameterized as basic MLP networks. – A diﬀerentiable rendering procedure based on classical volume rendering tech- niques, which we use to optimize these representations from standard RGB images. This includes a hierarchical sampling strategy to allocate the MLP’s capacity towards space with visible scene content.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#24</span>Input ImagesOptimize NeRFRender new viewsNeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#25</span>3</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#26</span>– A positional encoding to map each input 5D coordinate into a higher dimen- sional space, which enables us to successfully optimize neural radiance ﬁelds to represent high-frequency scene content.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#27</span>We demonstrate that our resulting neural radiance ﬁeld method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods, including works that ﬁt neural 3D representations to scenes as well as works that train deep convolutional networks to predict sampled volumetric representations. As far as we know, this paper presents the ﬁrst continuous neural scene representation that is able to render high-resolution photorealistic novel views of real objects and scenes from RGB images captured in natural settings.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#28</span>2 Related Work</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#29</span>A promising recent direction in computer vision is encoding objects and scenes in the weights of an MLP that directly maps from a 3D spatial location to an implicit representation of the shape, such as the signed distance [6] at that location. However, these methods have so far been unable to reproduce realistic scenes with complex geometry with the same ﬁdelity as techniques that represent scenes using discrete representations such as triangle meshes or voxel grids. In this section, we review these two lines of work and contrast them with our approach, which enhances the capabilities of neural scene representations to produce state-of-the-art results for rendering complex realistic scenes.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#30</span>A similar approach of using MLPs to map from low-dimensional coordinates to colors has also been used for representing other graphics functions such as im- ages [44], textured materials [12,31,36,37], and indirect illumination values [38].</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#31</span>Neural 3D shape representations Recent work has investigated the im- plicit representation of continuous 3D shapes as level sets by optimizing deep networks that map xyz coordinates to signed distance functions [15,32] or occu- pancy ﬁelds [11,27]. However, these models are limited by their requirement of access to ground truth 3D geometry, typically obtained from synthetic 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet [3]. Subsequent work has relaxed this requirement of ground truth 3D shapes by formulating diﬀerentiable rendering functions that allow neural implicit shape representations to be optimized using only 2D im- ages. Niemeyer et al. [29] represent surfaces as 3D occupancy ﬁelds and use a numerical method to ﬁnd the surface intersection for each ray, then calculate an exact derivative using implicit diﬀerentiation. Each ray intersection location is provided as the input to a neural 3D texture ﬁeld that predicts a diﬀuse color for that point. Sitzmann et al. [42] use a less direct neural 3D representation that simply outputs a feature vector and RGB color at each continuous 3D coordinate, and propose a diﬀerentiable rendering function consisting of a recurrent neural network that marches along each ray to decide where the surface is located.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#32</span>Though these techniques can potentially represent complicated and high- resolution geometry, they have so far been limited to simple shapes with low geometric complexity, resulting in oversmoothed renderings. We show that an al- ternate strategy of optimizing networks to encode 5D radiance ﬁelds (3D volumes</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#33</span>4</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#34</span>B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, M. Tancik et al.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#35</span>with 2D view-dependent appearance) can represent higher-resolution geometry and appearance to render photorealistic novel views of complex scenes.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#36</span>View synthesis and image-based rendering Given a dense sampling of views, photorealistic novel views can be reconstructed by simple light ﬁeld sam- ple interpolation techniques [21,5,7]. For novel view synthesis with sparser view sampling, the computer vision and graphics communities have made signiﬁcant progress by predicting traditional geometry and appearance representations from observed images. One popular class of approaches uses mesh-based representa- tions of scenes with either diﬀuse [48] or view-dependent [2,8,49] appearance. Diﬀerentiable rasterizers [4,10,23,25] or pathtracers [22,30] can directly optimize mesh representations to reproduce a set of input images using gradient descent. However, gradient-based mesh optimization based on image reprojection is often diﬃcult, likely because of local minima or poor conditioning of the loss land- scape. Furthermore, this strategy requires a template mesh with ﬁxed topology to be provided as an initialization before optimization [22], which is typically unavailable for unconstrained real-world scenes.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#37</span>Another class of methods use volumetric representations to address the task of high-quality photorealistic view synthesis from a set of input RGB images. Volumetric approaches are able to realistically represent complex shapes and materials, are well-suited for gradient-based optimization, and tend to produce less visually distracting artifacts than mesh-based methods. Early volumetric approaches used observed images to directly color voxel grids [19,40,45]. More recently, several methods [9,13,17,28,33,43,46,52] have used large datasets of mul- tiple scenes to train deep networks that predict a sampled volumetric represen- tation from a set of input images, and then use either alpha-compositing [34] or learned compositing along rays to render novel views at test time. Other works have optimized a combination of convolutional networks (CNNs) and sampled voxel grids for each speciﬁc scene, such that the CNN can compensate for dis- cretization artifacts from low resolution voxel grids [41] or allow the predicted voxel grids to vary based on input time or animation controls [24]. While these volumetric techniques have achieved impressive results for novel view synthe- sis, their ability to scale to higher resolution imagery is fundamentally limited by poor time and space complexity due to their discrete sampling — rendering higher resolution images requires a ﬁner sampling of 3D space. We circumvent this problem by instead encoding a continuous volume within the parameters of a deep fully-connected neural network, which not only produces signiﬁcantly higher quality renderings than prior volumetric approaches, but also requires just a fraction of the storage cost of those sampled volumetric representations.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#38</span>3 Neural Radiance Field Scene Representation</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#39</span>We represent a continuous scene as a 5D vector-valued function whose input is a 3D location x = (x, y, z) and 2D viewing direction (θ, φ), and whose output is an emitted color c = (r, g, b) and volume density σ.

We synthesize images by sampling 5D coordinates (location and viewing direction) along camera rays (a), feeding those locations into an MLP to produce a color and volume density (b), and using volume ren- dering techniques to composite these values into an image (c). This rendering function is diﬀerentiable, so we can optimize our scene representation by mini- mizing the residual between synthesized and ground truth observed images (d).</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#43</span>direction as a 3D Cartesian unit vector d. We approximate this continuous 5D scene representation with an MLP network FΘ : (x, d) → (c, σ) and optimize its weights Θ to map from each input 5D coordinate to its corresponding volume density and directional emitted color.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#44</span>We encourage the representation to be multiview consistent by restricting the network to predict the volume density σ as a function of only the location x, while allowing the RGB color c to be predicted as a function of both location and viewing direction. To accomplish this, the MLP FΘ ﬁrst processes the input 3D coordinate x with 8 fully-connected layers (using ReLU activations and 256 channels per layer), and outputs σ and a 256-dimensional feature vector. This feature vector is then concatenated with the camera ray’s viewing direction and passed to one additional fully-connected layer (using a ReLU activation and 128 channels) that output the view-dependent RGB color.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#45</span>See Fig. 3 for an example of how our method uses the input viewing direction to represent non-Lambertian eﬀects.

We render the color of any ray passing through the scene using principles from classical volume rendering [16]. The volume density σ(x) can be interpreted as the diﬀerential probability of a ray terminating at an inﬁnitesimal particle at location x.

Our neural radiance ﬁeld representation outputs RGB color as a 5D function of both spatial position x and viewing direction d. Here, we visualize example directional color distri- butions for two spatial locations in our neural representation of the Ship scene. In (a) and (b), we show the appearance of two ﬁxed 3D points from two dif- ferent camera positions: one on the side of the ship (orange insets) and one on the surface of the water (blue insets). Our method predicts the changing spec- ular appearance of these two 3D points, and in (c) we show how this behavior generalizes continuously across the whole hemisphere of viewing directions.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#62</span>The function T (t) denotes the accumulated transmittance along the ray from tn to t, i.e., the probability that the ray travels from tn to t without hitting any other particle.

Deter- ministic quadrature, which is typically used for rendering discretized voxel grids, would eﬀectively limit our representation’s resolution because the MLP would only be queried at a ﬁxed discrete set of locations. Instead, we use a stratiﬁed sampling approach where we partition [tn, tf ] into N evenly-spaced bins and then draw one sample uniformly at random from within each bin:</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#64</span>(cid:20)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#65</span>ti ∼ U</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#66</span>tn +</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#67</span>i − 1 N</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#68</span>(tf − tn), tn +</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#69</span>(cid:21) (tf − tn)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#70</span>.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#71</span>i N</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#72</span>(2)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#73</span>Although we use a discrete set of samples to estimate the integral, stratiﬁed sampling enables us to represent a continuous scene representation because it results in the MLP being evaluated at continuous positions over the course of optimization.

However, we observe that these components are not suﬃcient for achieving state-of-the-art quality, as demonstrated in Section 6.4). We introduce two improvements to enable representing high-resolution complex scenes. The ﬁrst is a positional encoding of the input coordinates that assists the MLP in representing high-frequency functions, and the second is a hierarchical sampling procedure that allows us to eﬃciently sample this high-frequency representation.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#95</span>5.1 Positional encoding</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#96</span>Despite the fact that neural networks are universal function approximators [14], we found that having the network FΘ directly operate on xyzθφ input coordi- nates results in renderings that perform poorly at representing high-frequency variation in color and geometry. This is consistent with recent work by Rahaman et al. [35], which shows that deep networks are biased towards learning lower fre- quency functions.

However, Transformers use it for a diﬀerent goal of providing the discrete positions of tokens in a sequence as input to an architecture that does not contain any notion of order. In contrast, we use these functions to map continuous input coordinates into a higher dimensional space to enable our MLP to more easily approximate a higher frequency function. Concurrent work on a related problem of modeling 3D protein structure from projections [51] also utilizes a similar input coordinate mapping.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#105</span>5.2 Hierarchical volume sampling</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#106</span>Our rendering strategy of densely evaluating the neural radiance ﬁeld network at N query points along each camera ray is ineﬃcient: free space and occluded regions that do not contribute to the rendered image are still sampled repeat- edly. We draw inspiration from early work in volume rendering [20] and propose a hierarchical representation that increases rendering eﬃciency by allocating samples proportionally to their expected eﬀect on the ﬁnal rendering.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#107</span>Instead of just using a single network to represent the scene, we simultane- ously optimize two networks: one “coarse” and one “ﬁne”. We ﬁrst sample a set of Nc locations using stratiﬁed sampling, and evaluate the “coarse” network at these locations as described in Eqns. 2 and 3. Given the output of this “coarse” network, we then produce a more informed sampling of points along each ray where samples are biased towards the relevant parts of the volume. To do this, we ﬁrst rewrite the alpha composited color from the coarse network ˆCc(r) in Eqn. 3 as a weighted sum of all sampled colors ci along the ray:</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#108</span>ˆCc(r) =</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#109</span>Nc(cid:88)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#110</span>i=1</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#111</span>wici ,</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#112</span>wi = Ti(1 − exp(−σiδi)) .</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#113</span>(5)</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#114</span>Normalizing these weights as ˆwi = wi/(cid:80)Nc j=1 wj produces a piecewise-constant PDF along the ray. We sample a second set of Nf locations from this distribution using inverse transform sampling, evaluate our “ﬁne” network at the union of the ﬁrst and second set of samples, and compute the ﬁnal rendered color of the ray ˆCf (r) using Eqn. 3 but using all Nc +Nf samples. This procedure allocates more samples to regions we expect to contain visible content. This addresses a similar goal as importance sampling, but we use the sampled values as a nonuniform discretization of the whole integration domain rather than treating each sample as an independent probabilistic estimate of the entire integral.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#115</span>5.3</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#116</span>Implementation details</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#117</span>We optimize a separate neural continuous volume representation network for each scene.

At each optimization iteration, we randomly sample a batch of camera rays from the set of all pixels in the dataset, and then follow the hierarchical sampling described in Sec. 5.2 to query Nc samples from the coarse network and Nc + Nf samples from the ﬁne network. We then use the volume rendering procedure described in Sec. 4 to render the color of each ray from both sets of samples.

It uses a trained 3D convolutional network to directly predict a discretized frustum-sampled RGBα grid (multiplane image or MPI [52]) for each input view, then renders novel views by alpha compositing and blending nearby MPIs into the novel viewpoint.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#177</span>6.3 Discussion</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#178</span>We thoroughly outperform both baselines that also optimize a separate network per scene (NV and SRN) in all scenarios. Furthermore, we produce qualitatively and quantitatively superior renderings compared to LLFF (across all except one metric) while using only their input images as our entire training set.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#179</span>The SRN method produces heavily smoothed geometry and texture, and its representational power for view synthesis is limited by selecting only a single depth and color per camera ray. The NV baseline is able to capture reasonably detailed volumetric geometry and appearance, but its use of an underlying ex- plicit 1283 voxel grid prevents it from scaling to represent ﬁne details at high resolutions. LLFF speciﬁcally provides a “sampling guideline” to not exceed 64 pixels of disparity between input views, so it frequently fails to estimate cor- rect geometry in the synthetic datasets which contain up to 400-500 pixels of disparity between views. Additionally, LLFF blends between diﬀerent scene rep- resentations for rendering diﬀerent views, resulting in perceptually-distracting inconsistency as is apparent in our supplementary video.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#180</span>The biggest practical tradeoﬀs between these methods are time versus space. All compared single scene methods take at least 12 hours to train per scene. In contrast, LLFF can process a small input dataset in under 10 minutes. However, LLFF produces a large 3D voxel grid for every input image, resulting in enor- mous storage requirements (over 15GB for one “Realistic Synthetic” scene). Our method requires only 5 MB for the network weights (a relative compression of 3000× compared to LLFF), which is even less memory than the input images alone for a single scene from any of our datasets.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#181</span>6.4 Ablation studies</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#182</span>We validate our algorithm’s design choices and parameters with an extensive ablation study in Table 2.

Row 1 shows a minimalist version of our model without positional encoding (PE), view- dependence (VD), or hierarchical sampling (H). In rows 2–4 we remove these three components one at a time from the full model, observing that positional encoding (row 2) and view-dependence (row 3) provide the largest quantitative beneﬁt followed by hierarchical sampling (row 4). Rows 5–6 show how our per- formance decreases as the number of input images is reduced. Note that our method’s performance using only 25 input images still exceeds NV, SRN, and LLFF across all metrics when they are provided with 100 images (see supple- mentary material).

We demonstrate that represent- ing scenes as 5D neural radiance ﬁelds (an MLP that outputs volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance as a function of 3D location and 2D viewing direction) produces better renderings than the previously-dominant approach of training deep convolutional networks to output discretized voxel representations. Although we have proposed a hierarchical sampling strategy to make render- ing more sample-eﬃcient (for both training and testing), there is still much more progress to be made in investigating techniques to eﬃciently optimize and ren- der neural radiance ﬁelds. Another direction for future work is interpretability: sampled representations such as voxel grids and meshes admit reasoning about the expected quality of rendered views and failure modes, but it is unclear how to analyze these issues when we encode scenes in the weights of a deep neural network. We believe that this work makes progress towards a graphics pipeline based on real world imagery, where complex scenes could be composed of neural radiance ﬁelds optimized from images of actual objects and scenes.</div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#197</span>Acknowledgements We thank Kevin Cao, Guowei Frank Yang, and Nithin Raghavan for comments and discussions.

For exper- iments with synthetic images, we scale the scene so that it lies within a cube of side length 2 centered at the origin, and only query the representation within this bounding volume. Our dataset of real images contains content that can ex- ist anywhere between the closest point and inﬁnity, so we use normalized device coordinates to map the depth range of these points into [−1, 1]. This shifts all the ray origins to the near plane of the scene, maps the perspective rays of the camera to parallel rays in the transformed volume, and uses disparity (inverse depth) instead of metric depth, so all coordinates are now bounded.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#285</span>Training Details For real scene data, we regularize our network by adding random Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance to the output σ values (before passing them through the ReLU) during optimization, ﬁnding that this slightly improves visual performance for rendering novel views. We implement our model in Tensorﬂow [1].</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#286</span>Rendering Details To render new views at test time, we sample 64 points per ray through the coarse network and 64 + 128 = 192 points per ray through the ﬁne network, for a total of 256 network queries per ray.

Input vectors are shown in green, intermediate hidden layers are shown in blue, output vectors are shown in red, and the number inside each block signiﬁes the vector’s dimen- sion. All layers are standard fully-connected layers, black arrows indicate layers with ReLU activations, orange arrows indicate layers with no activation, dashed black arrows indicate layers with sigmoid activation, and “+” denotes vector concatenation. The positional encoding of the input location (γ(x)) is passed through 8 fully-connected ReLU layers, each with 256 channels. We follow the DeepSDF [32] architecture and include a skip connection that concatenates this input to the ﬁfth layer’s activation. An additional layer outputs the volume den- sity σ (which is rectiﬁed using a ReLU to ensure that the output volume density is nonnegative) and a 256-dimensional feature vector. This feature vector is con- catenated with the positional encoding of the input viewing direction (γ(d)), and is processed by an additional fully-connected ReLU layer with 128 channels. A ﬁnal layer (with a sigmoid activation) outputs the emitted RGB radiance at position x, as viewed by a ray with direction d.</div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#290</span>dataset requires 640k rays per image, and our real scenes require 762k rays per image, resulting in between 150 and 200 million network queries per rendered image.
