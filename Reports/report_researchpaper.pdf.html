Introduction</span></div><div class="paragraph citation-issue ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#10</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">Mobile devices, smartphones and tablet computers in particular, have generated a lot of  interest  among  researchers  in  recent  years  (Byrne  &  Diem,  2014).  This  is  because  the  opportunities these new technologies may offer (e.g. individualized learning, the variety  of  mobile  apps  available,  easy  access  to  the  internet)  and/or  the  fact  that  they  are  increasingly  more  common  among  learners  make  them  an  important  and  potentially  useful addition to formal and informal language learning.</span><div><span class="cit-link" onclick="alert(`Source: [SECONDARY - Cited by Profiling mobil...] Tablets for informal language learning: Student usage and attitudes\nSimilarity: 0.76`)">[Citation Issue]</span></div></div><div class="paragraph citation-issue ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#11</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">According  to  Benson  (2011),  there  has  always  been  a  connection  between  educational  technologies and learner autonomy to the extent that they have often been intended for  independent  practice.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  this  link  and  “future  enquiry  and  practice  into  technology-mediated  learner  autonomy  will  need  to  be  increasingly  aligned to the tools, settings, and activities that are of significance to language learners”  (Reinders & White, 2016, p. 151). Reinders and White (2016) further argue that as long  as  “the  potential  range  of  settings,  tools,  and  experiences  is  now  virtually  limitless,  individuals need to be increasingly adept at critical adaptive learning in order to benefit  from and contribute effectively to those settings” (p. 151). Beyond doubt, contemporary  language  teachers  should  equip  foreign/second  language  learners  with  appropriate  knowledge  concerning  the  affordances  of  mobile  devices  for  language  study  and  they  should  prepare  them  for  effective  usage  of  such  devices  for  this  purpose.  It  is  also  of  paramount  importance,  for  both  researchers  and  practitioners,  to  comprehend  the  link  between  the  modalities  of  the  language  learners'  organization  of  their  own  learning  experiences  and  environments  and  the  role  mobile  technologies,  in  particular  smartphones and tablets, play in these contexts.</span><div><span class="cit-link" onclick="alert(`Source: [DIRECT] Why and how do distance learners use mobile devices for language learning\nSimilarity: 0.80`)">[Citation Issue]</span></div></div><div class="paragraph citation-issue ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#12</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">Taking into consideration the above-mentioned issues, the study reported in this article  investigated  ways  advanced  English  language  students  use  their  mobile  devices  (i.e.  smartphones and tablet computers) for their language learning.

Autonomy in foreign/second language learning</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#18</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">The  concept  of  autonomy  in  second/foreign  language  learning  and  teaching  has  been  the  focus  of  attention  for  many  researchers  and  practitioners  for  more  than  three  decades.  According  to  Benson  (2001),  the  notion  of  autonomy  was  introduced  and  popularized  in  1981  by  Henri  Holec  in  his  seminal  report  for  the  Council  of  Europe  entitled Autonomy  in  Foreign  Language  Learning in  which  the  researcher  defined  autonomy in the context of language learning as “the ability to take charge of one’s own  learning” (Holec, 1981, p. 3). Holec’s idea of autonomy encompasses some components  and  capacities  on  the  part  of  language  learners  (e.g.  self-directed  learning).  For  some  other  authors  autonomy  also  involves  “a  capacity  –  for  detachment,  critical  reflection,  decision-making, and independent action” (Little, 1991, p. 4) and “the capacity to take  control  of  one’s  own  learning”  (Benson,  2001,  p.  46).  As  stated  by  Benson  (2011,  p.  16),  “autonomy  is  multidimensional  and  takes  many  different  forms  according  to  the  person,  the  setting,  and  multiple  contextual  and  micro-contextual  factors”  and  it  is  “a  multi-faceted  concept  that  consists  of  several  layers”  (Reinders,  2011,  p.  48)  whose  roots are  based  in  political,  societal  and  educational  developments.  In  addition  to  this,  work  on  autonomy  emphasizes  social  dimensions  of  learner  autonomy  in  view  of  the  fact that “autonomous learners always  do things  for themselves, but they may or may  not  do  things  on  their  own”  (Little,  2009,  p.  223)  and  that  by  means  of  social  interactions  language  learners  “develop  a  capacity  to  analyze,  reflect  upon  and  synthesize information to create new perspectives” (Lee, 2011, p. 88). It should also be  noted that recent research shows that fostering autonomy is no longer predominantly a  matter of individualizing learning through out-of-class initiatives since the dominance of  classroom-based  approaches  (Benson,  2011).  Finally,  it  has  to  be  added  that  researchers,  in  general,  seem  to  be  in  agreement  with  the  following  claims  suggested  by  Benson  (2011):  “(a)  language  learners  naturally  tend  to  take  control  of  their  learning,  (b)  learners  who  lack  autonomy  are  capable  of  developing  it,  and  (c)  autonomous  language  learning  is  more  effective  than  non-autonomous  language  learning” (p. 16).</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#19</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 70.0%">Perhaps in order to define the concept of autonomy in language learning it is necessary  to  understand  who  autonomous  learners  are.  As  Littlewood  (1996)  claims,  an  autonomous  learner  is  “one  who  has  independent  capacity  to  make  and  carry  out  choices  which  govern  his  or  her  actions”  (p.  428).  The  researcher  argues  that  this  capacity  depends  on  two  major  components  such  as  ability  and  willingness,  and  he  claims  that  the  attributes  can  also  be  further  subdivided.  Thus,  ability  depends  on  having  knowledge  about  the  options  from  which  one  can  choose  and  skills  so  as  to  choose  the  most  suitable  alternatives.  When  it  comes  to  willingness,  this  depends  on  having  motivation  and  confidence  in  order  to  take  responsibility  for  adequate  choices.  Moreover,  Littlewood  (1996)  argues  that  if  an  individual  is  to  be  successful  in  being  autonomous, all of these components have to be present all together.</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#20</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">At  the  close  of  this  section,  a  few  words  are  in  order  on  the  notion  of  autonomous  language  learning.  An  interesting  description  of  the  concept  in  question  is  offered  by  Reinders  (2011),  who  defines  autonomous  language  learning  as  “an  act  of  learning  whereby  motivated  learners  consciously  make  informed  decisions  about  that  learning”  (p.  48).  According  to  the  said  researcher,  it  is  not  possible  or  needed  in  all  acts  of  learning  to  be  able  or  ready  to  intentionally  make  decisions  since  different  learning  situations present different demands. Reinders (2011) further argues that “autonomy is  not an either-or concept, but has to be seen as a continuum” (p. 48). This is because a  learner  can  display  more  or  less  autonomy  in  different  learning  circumstances.  Autonomy,  in  Reinders’  terms  changes  over  time  between  skills  and  within  skills  and  thus it is difficult to achieve and is not invariably permanent (Reinders, 2011).</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#21</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">19</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#22</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 20.0%">The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#23</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">2.2. Autonomy and new technologies</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#24</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">As  stated  in  the  previous  section,  the  concept  of  autonomy  has  been  one  of  the  most  researched areas in the field of second/foreign language learning and teaching over the  last  few  decades.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  field  of  learner  autonomy  started  to  be  influenced  by  technology  in  the  mid-1990s  as  a  result  of  the  growing  influence  of  the  internet  on  almost  every  sphere  of  our  life  (including  second/foreign  language  education)  and  the  opportunities  for  online  collaboration  and  communication  (Reinders & White, 2016). As stated by Benson and Chik (2010), the latest generations  of new technologies, particularly those encompassing the internet, user-generated Web  content  and  mobility,  seem  to  be  having  a  bearing  on  the  way  autonomous  language  learning  develops.  Perhaps,  one  of  the  most  important  benefits  of  implementing  new  technologies into language learning is the fact that they provide occasions for language  learners who do not have direct access to the target language. This is because the use  of new technologies, including mobile technology, allow them to “bypass classrooms and  go  directly  to  target  language  texts  and  users  through  the  internet  and  social  media”  (Benson, 2011, p. 17).</span></div><div class="paragraph citation-issue ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#25</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">When  it  comes  to  the  use  of  mobile  technology,  and,  in  particular,  smartphones  and  tablet  computers,  for  learning  a  foreign  or  second  language,  they  can  assist  language  learners  with  their  learning  endeavors  by  granting  access  to  numerous  language  resources  whenever  and  wherever  such  learners  need  them  and/or  they  happen  to  be  (Jones,  2015).  In  Jones’s  opinion,  such  language  involvement  might  comprise,  for  instance,  the  use  of  chunks  of  spare  time  for  language  practice,  searching  for  target  language vocabulary in relevant contexts or interactions on social media (Jones, 2015).  Furthermore, by having a mobile device a language learner has the opportunity to take  control of his or her learning, direct it and engage in language activities that meet his or  her  individual  needs  and  goals  (Kukulska-Hulme,  Traxler  &  Pettit,  2007;  Pettit  &  Kukulska-Hulme 2007).</span><div><span class="cit-link" onclick="alert(`Source: [DIRECT] Why and how do distance learners use mobile devices for language learning\nSimilarity: 0.78`)">[Citation Issue]</span></div></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#26</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">in</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#27</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">the</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#28</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">learning,</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#29</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">language</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#30</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">autonomous</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#31</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">Given the importance attached to new technologies, and, in particular the potential role  of  mobile  devices  terms mobile  learning and mobile devices (MobDs) need first to be explained. As for mobile learning,  no single  agreed-upon definition of the term exists in the literature (Oz, 2015). This  is  because  some  researchers  define  mobile  learning  as  an  extension  of  e-learning  built  upon  mobile  devices  whereas  some  other  researchers  understand    it  as  learning  that  happens anywhere and anytime (cf. Oz, 2015). As far as mobile devices are concerned,  they can be  defined as “any device that is small, autonomous  and unobtrusive enough  to  accompany  us  in  every  moment  and  can  be  used  for  educational  purposes”  (Trifanova Knapp, Ronchetti & Gamper, 2004, p. 3) or as “hand held electronic devices  that can be comfortably carried around in a pocket or bag, including MP3 players, digital  recorders,  e-readers,  tablets,  and  smartphones”  (Kukulska-Hulme,  Norris  &  Donohue,  2015, p. 39).</span></div><div class="paragraph citation-issue ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#32</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">A lot of studies concerning the use of mobile technology and mobile devices in language  learning  have  been  published.  The  findings  of  these  studies  concentrated  on,  for  example, language learners’ views on the use of mobile devices in language instruction  (e.g.  Oz,  2015),  students’  attitudes  towards  using  mobile  phones  as  instructional  tools  for foreign language learning (e.g. Cakir, 2015), profiling mobile language learners (e.g.  Byrne  &  Diem,  2014),  their  effect  on  learning  a  foreign/second  language  (e.g.  Nah,  White  &  Sussex,  2008;  Cavus  &  Ibrahim,  2009;  Zhang,  Song  &  Burston,  2011),  distance  language  learning  (e.g.  Demouy,  Jones,  Kan,  Kukulska-Hulme  &  Eardley,  2016),  informal  language  learning  practices  (Reinders  &  Cho,  2011;  Jones,  2015),  learners’  use  of  mobile  devices  for  learning  a  foreign  language  (Stockwell,  2007;  Dashtestani,  2015)  and  autonomy  in  language  learning  (e.g.  Díaz-Vera,  2012;  Djoub,  2015).  In  addition  to  this,  researchers  investigated  a  number  of  applications  of  mobile  devices and presented both benefits and drawbacks of the usage of mobile technologies  (e.g.  Miangah  &  Nezarat,  2012),  discussed  the  use  of  mobile  devices  in  supporting  social  contacts  and  collaborative  learning  (e.g.  Kukulska-Hulme  &  Shield,  2008)  and  offered guidelines related to the implementation  of mobile  learning into second/foreign  language instruction (e.g. Kukulska-Hulme et al., 2015).</span><div><span class="cit-link" onclick="alert(`Source: [DIRECT] Why and how do distance learners use mobile devices for language learning\nSimilarity: 0.84`)">[Citation Issue]</span></div></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#33</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">20</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#34</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 20.0%">The EUROCALL Review, Volume 25, No. 2, September 2017</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#35</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">3.

Taking  this  important  matter  into  consideration,  and  in  view  of  the  fact  that  mobile  technology,  including  mobile  devices  such  as  smartphones  and  tablet  computers,  are  ubiquitous  and  substantial  constituents  of  almost  every  language  learner’s  everyday  life,  the  abovementioned question was modified and posed in this study in the following way:</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#38</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 70.0%">Do  students  engage  with  their  mobile  devices  to  develop  learning  experiences  (e.g. the  use  of  mobile  devices  for  formal  and/or  informal  English  language  study)  that  meet  their  needs  and  goals  (e.g.  the  development  of  the  target  language skills and sub-skills) as English language learners?

Participants</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#40</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">The  participants  were  20  Polish  university  students  of  English  philology,  nine  of  whom  (seven  females  and  two  males)  were  in  the  second  year  of  their  BA  programme,  six  (five females and one male) in the third year and five (all females) in the second year of  their MA program (1). The study participants were on average 22.22 years old (20.66 -  year 2, BA; 21.82 - year 3, BA and 24.50 - year 2, MA). The subjects reported having  learned English for an average of 11.38 years (10.49  - year 2, BA; 11.27  - year 3, BA  and  12.21  -  year  2,  MA).  The  proficiency  level  represented  by  the  participants  of  the  study could be described as somewhere between B1 and B2 (second year BA students),  B2  and  C1  (third  year  BA  students)  and  C1  and  C2  (second  year  MA  students),  as  specified  in  the  levels  laid  out  in  the Common  European  Framework  of  Reference  for  Languages.</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#41</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 40.0%">3.3. Data collection and analysis</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#42</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 70.0%">The data were gathered by means of a semi-structured interview. This interview format  was  chosen  intentionally  since  it  uses  a  set  of  prepared  in  advance  guiding  questions  and  prompts  and  interviewees  are  encouraged  to  elaborate  on  the  problems  raised  during it (Dörnyei, 2007). As Dörnyei (2007) explains, in this type of the interview “the  interviewer provides guidelines and direction (hence the ‘-structured’ part in the name),  but  is  also  keen  to  follow  up  interesting  developments  and  to  let  the  interviewee  elaborate on certain issues (hence the ‘semi-’ part)” (p. 136).</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#43</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">During  the  interview,  the  present  researcher  attempted  to  encourage  the  subjects  to  describe  their  learning  experiences  concerning  the  use  of  mobile  devices  for  English  study. This was a form of introspection where the students were prompted to examine  their  behaviors  and  provide  a  first  person  narrative  of  such  experiences.  All  the  study  participants  were  informed  that  the  interview  concerned  the  use  of  mobile  devices  for  English  study  and  they  were  asked  for  permission  to  be  digitally  recorded.  In  order  to  obtain relevant data the following questions were asked (2):</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#44</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 40.0%">  Do  you  use  your  mobile  devices  (e.g.  smartphones,  tablets,  MP3  players,</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#45</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">PDAs) for learning English?</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#46</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 40.0%">  Why do you use your mobile device(s) for learning English?    When did you start using your mobile device(s)  for learning English?

The analysis  started with partial transcription of the important parts of the data (Dörnyei, 2007) on a  computer  word  processor  program Microsoft  Word  2016.  Then  the  transcribed  parts  of  the  data  were  read  several  times  in  order  to  look  for  common  themes  and  frequently  occurring  information.  The  recurring  ideas  were  coded  and  recoded,  revised  and  updated.  The  researcher  used the highlighting  function  of  the  word processor  program  which  allows  the  user  to  highlight  the  text  on  the  transcript  with  different  colors  and  comments  to  record  any  observations  and  thematic  categories  recognized  in  the  data.  The  emerged  categories  were  reviewed,  compared,  modified  and  either  merged  or  abandoned. It should also be noted that the obtained data were analyzed quantitatively.  This  type of  analysis  involved  counting  the  number  of  the interviewees’  responses  and  calculating percentages.</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#63</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">4.

In  addition,  the  numerical  information  in  the  table  indicates  that  the  participants,  on  average,  had  been  using  them  for  English  language  study  for  about  3.80  years  (minimum  2,  maximum  6  years).  9  (45%)  and  11  (55%)  of  the  subjects  started  using their  mobile  devices  at  senior  high  school  and university,  respectively.  It  should  also  be  added  that,  with  the  exception  of  one  student  (i.e.  S9),  all  the  other  participants  claimed  to  use  their  mobile  devices  in  order  to  learn  English  much  more  frequently with time. Finally, more than half of the students (55%) regarded themselves  as experienced or fairly experienced users of their MobDs for English language learning;  however, 45% claimed not to be very skilful in this area.</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#68</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">Table 1.

As for  the students  who used their smartphones or tablet computers in their leisure time, some of them did  it  with  the  aim  of  reading  English  texts,  listening  to  audio  resources,  checking  and  learning  new  vocabulary,  preparing  multimedia  presentations  and  playing  language  games. This is not to say, of course, that this group of learners did not use their MobDs  at  all  during  classes;  however,  the  use  of  MobDs  in  this  respect  was  only  limited  to  checking  target  language  vocabulary  (e.g. S1:  I  use  my  smartphone,  for  example,  to  check  something  I  don’t  understand  (...)  I  installed  a  dictionary  and  I  use  it  to  find  words). When it comes to the subjects who claimed to use their MobDs  most frequently  in the classroom, they used them to check unfamiliar vocabulary and/or find words they  needed  during  various  language  activities.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  these  students were not very willing to use their MobDs at home in view of the fact that they  favored their home computers. For example:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#203</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 30.0%">S7: I  use  them  outside  of  University  in  order  to  learn  and  practice  English  vocabulary and to prepare multimedia presentations.</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#204</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 30.0%">S13: In  my  free  time  I  learn  English  words  and  phrases,  listen  to  English  recordings and I read various texts in English.</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#205</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 70.0%">S19: Yes,  I  use  my  smartphone  and  tablet  for  out-of-class  learning  but  I  also  use them during classes mostly to check words and collocations.</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#206</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 70.0%">S16: I think I do this during practical English language classes more regularly in  the classroom  than  outside  of  it  (...)

In  addition  to  this,  some  referred  to  pronunciation  and only  a  few  students  mentioned  grammar  and  practicing  reading,  listening  and  speaking  skills.  As  far  as  practicing  English  vocabulary  is  concerned,  the  subjects  chose  to  practice  it  through  their  smartphones and/or tables because they regarded this language subsystem as the most  important  to  learn,  they  praised  their  MobDs  for  providing  them  with  quick  and  easy  access  to  needed  words  and  see  the  way  they  were  used  in  given  sentences.  As  was  stressed by many of  the interviewees,  learning English vocabulary by means of mobile  devices also allowed them to check correct pronunciation of words (i.e. they listened to  it or paid attention to phonetic transcription of words). The following excerpts exemplify  the most typical usage of MobDs by the study participants:</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#216</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 50.0%">S3: (…) as for vocabulary I guess it’s much faster to search for words and know  how to use them in sentences.</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#217</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 40.0%">S6: It’s easy and it’s very easy to look for words when I need them.</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#218</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">S12: (…) I need vocabulary not only to communicate in English (…) when I look  for  words  I  look  at  contexts  words  are  used  (...)

Phonetic transcription of words ... yes but not often unless audio is poor  quality  or  it  seems  to  sound  somehow  differently  ...  then  I  make  sure  how  a  word is pronounced and I read its phonetic transcription given there.</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#219</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">As  mentioned  earlier,  only  a  few  students  resorted  to  their  MobDs  in  order  to  practice  other language areas such as listening, reading and speaking as well as grammar. This  is  because  they  preferred  more  traditional  resources  (e.g.  grammar  books),  they  used  other devices (e.g. laptop computers) or they regarded themselves as quite proficient in  particular language skills and thus they did not feel the need to master them by way of  MobDs.

This is because  access to  a  smartphone  or  a  tablet  allows  some  learners    devote  more  time  to  learning  English  (S1: Yes, I think so. I think I spend more time ... If I was to use traditional materials,  for example, books, I wouldn’t devote so much time to it.; S15: It seems to me that I  dedicate  more  time  to  learn  English  this  way  and  I  learn  more.),  encouraged  another  student  to  learn  more  (S6: I’m  more  willing  to  use  my  smartphone  than  open  a  paper  dictionary.)  and  allowed  yet  another  subject  to  learn  more  vocabulary  (S12: Yes,  definitely.  I  wouldn’t  have  learned  these  words  if  I  hadn’t  used  my  phone.).

Discussion and conclusions</span></div><div class="paragraph citation-issue ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#233</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">The picture that emerges from the analysis of the collected data regarding the advanced  learners'  use  of  mobile  devices  for  learning  English  is  relatively  encouraging.  This  is  because  all  the  study  participants  used,  at  least  to  some  extent,  their  mobile  devices  (i.e.  smartphones  and/or  tablet  computers)  in  order  to  learn  the  English  language  autonomously.  Moreover,  the positive  impact  of  using mobile  devices  for  English  study  was  acknowledged  by  the  majority  of  the  interviewees.  Their  beneficial  contribution  to  their  English  development  was  chiefly  linked  with  easy  access  to  English  language  resources,  the  opportunity  to  store  them,  comfort  in  using  their  smartphones  and  tablets anywhere and anytime as well as perceived gains in English learning. The results  of  the  study  also  showed  that  all  interviewees  engaged  with  their  smartphones  and/or  tablet  computers  to  practice  the  target  language  vocabulary  (plus  some  students  also  claimed to learn pronunciation of English words)  and the majority of the subjects used  their  mobile  devices  autonomously  in  their  leisure  time  as  well  as  during  language  classes. Such a state of affairs can be explained in terms of increased awareness on the  part of some students of the beneficial role of MobDs in foreign language learning, their  ability  to  reach  for  appropriate  tools  and  retrieve  needed  information  to  achieve  their  goals and adjust their learning of the target language to their personal learning styles.</span><div><span class="cit-link" onclick="alert(`Source: [DIRECT] Why and how do distance learners use mobile devices for language learning\nSimilarity: 0.76`)">[Citation Issue]</span></div></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#234</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 99.0%">Despite this positive view of MobDs reported by the study participants, the results of the  study  also  revealed  that  only  a  few  subjects  engaged  with  their  mobile  devices  to  master target language skills such as reading, listening, writing and speaking as well as  English  language  grammar.  In  addition,  some  interviewees  limited  themselves  to  a  rather  intuitive  and  perhaps  even  spontaneous  use  of  their  mobile  devices  in  the  language  classroom.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  almost  half  of  the  subjects  regarded  themselves  as  quite  inexperienced  in  using  their  mobile  devices  when  it  comes  to  learning the English language despite the fact that some of the students had been using  them  with  the  intention  of  learning  English  for  years.  Taking  all  these  findings  into  account,  one  may  conclude  that  this  is  due  to  a  failure  or  underestimation  of  the  role  and  place  of  mobile  devices  in  foreign  language  learning  and  teaching  on  the  part  of  language teachers. It seems therefore warranted to say that the subjects’ use of mobile  devices  could be  altered  if  teachers  took  into  account  the  benefits  they  may  offer.  For  this  reason  language  teachers  should,  for  instance,  present  the  affordances  of  mobile  technology  and  discuss  them  with  students  during  language  classes.  They  should  also  select mobile apps and create opportunities for using them in- and out-of-class learning  by  offering  or  designing  tasks  devoted  to  practicing  a  variety  of  language  skills  and  subsystems suitable for the use of such devices. If this were to happen, teachers need  to  respond  quickly  to  the  constant  and  dynamic  changes  in  contemporary  foreign/second  language  learning  and  teaching  contexts  by  undergoing  official  teacher  training not only in the area of technology-mediated language learning and teaching but  also in the context of learner autonomy.</span></div><div class="paragraph ai-generated"><span class="p-meta">#235</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 70.0%">As with all studies, the study reported in this paper has some limitations. Although the  interviewees represented a range of experience of English language learning,  the small  number  of  participants  reduces  the  generalizability  of  the  results.  Another  limitation  is  related to the fact that the group was largely homogenous, i.e. the subjects came from  the  same  institution  and  all  studied  English.

Perhaps  a  different  set  of  questions,  their  wording  or  a  series  of  such  interviews  carried  out  over  a  particular  period  of  time  (say  one  academic  year)  may  have  yielded  more  detailed  and  insightful  results.  Despite  these  limitations,  this  study  provided  some  insights  into  why  and  how  advanced  English  language  learners  engage  with  their  mobile  devices  to  develop  learning  experiences.  It  should  be  stressed,  however, that teacher involvement in creating conditions conducive to the use of mobile  devices  for  language  study  may  result  in  greater  learner  engagement  with  mobile  technology  (i.e.  mobile  devices)  and,  at  the  same  time,  may  lead  to  greater  students’  independence in learning the target language.</span><div><span class="cit-link" onclick="alert(`Source: [DIRECT] Why and how do distance learners use mobile devices for language learning\nSimilarity: 0.75`)">[Citation Issue]</span></div></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#239</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">References</span></div><div class="paragraph"><span class="p-meta">#240</span><span class="text-wrapper" title="🤖 AI Probability: 0.0%">Benson,  P.
